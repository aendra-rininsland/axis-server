This is a MongoJS/Express/Bootstrap-based CRUD wrapper for [AxisJS](http://github.com/times/axisJS).

What this means is that you can create and save charts with ease using its interface.

### Cool features

#### OEmbed

To get an OEmbed version of a chart, just query:

`http://axis.yourdomain.com/oembed/?url=<url-to-chart>&width=<chart-width>&height=<chart-height>`

#### Roadmap

+ I might add support to save to S3.
